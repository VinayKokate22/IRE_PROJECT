-----Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photos from racy shoot revealed  -----  August 1   12:57am
-----
Here’s the nation’s would-be first lady — and right beside her, a second lady.Three years before she met husband Donald Trump, Melania Trump was snapped in a nude frolic with another female model, bombshell photos obtained exclusively by The Post show.   The lesbian-themed pics are from a two-day photo shoot in Manhattan in 1995, when Melania Knauss, as she was called, was 25 years old and modeling under the name “Melania K.”Several were featured in Max Magazine, a now-defunct French men’s monthly, more than 20 years ago. Others have never been in print —  until now .The raciest of the photos shows Melania lying nude in a bed as Scandinavian model Emma Eriksson, also naked, embraces her from behind, just below her breasts, which are fully exposed.In another photo, Eriksson wears sheer stockings, a low-cut bustier, high heels and a long robe — all designed by John Galliano — and raises a whip as if preparing to spank Melania, who pretends to recoil. Melania is more conservatively dressed in a skin-tight gown and high heels.“I always loved women together, because I have been with a lot of women who desired the ménage à trois,” said Jarl Ale de Basseville, the French fashion photographer who snapped the pictures.“This is beauty and not porn. I am always shocked by the porn industry because they are destroying the emotion and the essence of purity and simplicity.”The shoot took place in a Chelsea apartment that doubled as a photo studio,  said de Basseville , a Paris artist and fashion photographer who was briefly based in New York in the mid-’90s.Part of the shoot, which de Basseville said was inspired by Renaissance art, took place on the building’s rooftop, said a fashion-industry insider who was present at one of the photo sessions.Melania behaved “like a true professional” during one of the nighttime shoots with Eriksson, the source said.“She was charming throughout,” said the source, adding that the pics’ lesbian theme didn’t faze her. “She was always smiling, with a very pleasant personality and was polite and very well educated.”Melania had recently arrived in the city from modeling stints in Paris and Milan at the time. In Gotham, she was booked for mostly commercial work and was later featured in an ad for Camel cigarettes, the source told The Post.Her sexy photo spread appeared in the January 1996 issue of Max Magazine, whose cover featured a photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford.In addition to the lesbian-themed shots, de Basseville  took several nude pictures  of Melania from different angles.In one of them, Melania pouts at the camera while clad only in stilettos. In another, her back is to the camera, and her arms are raised as if up against a wall.“I think it is important to show the beauty and freedom of the woman, and I am very proud of these pictures because they celebrate Melania’s beauty, ’’ de Basseville said.Asked about the photos, Donald Trump said: “Melania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines. This was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.”The Slovenian-born beauty, now 46, first met Trump at a Fashion Week party in 1998. They married in January 2005 and have one son, Baron, 10.She has modeled for Sports Illustrated and Vogue among other publications, posing for such top photographers as Helmut Newton and Mario Testino.

Two former top Venezuelan anti-narcotics officials have been charged by federal authorities in Brooklyn for their alleged roles in an international drug-trafficking scheme, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.Néstor Luis Reverol Torres, 51, the ex-general director of Venezuela’s National Anti-Drug Office, and Edilberto José Molina, 53, the former sub-director, allegedly aided cocaine runners who smuggled drugs into the US between 2008 and 2010, Brooklyn federal-court documents state.Torres and Molina allegedly tipped off traffickers about drug raids and law-enforcement whereabouts. They are also accused of arranging for the release of people arrested on drug charges and preventing the deportation of suspects targeted by the US and other countries.They were indicted in Brooklyn federal court in January. They are not in US custody.

**************-----Zika outbreak prompts travel warning for parts of Miami  -----  August 1   4:04pm
-----
A growing Zika outbreak in Florida has forced public health officials to issue a rare domestic travel warning, urging pregnant women — and those trying to have a child — to avoid a trendy section of the city where the virus has been spreading.A Zika outbreak in one of Miami’s trendiest neighborhoods prompted feds to issue an unprecedented domestic travel warning Monday, as the number of locally transmitted infections in the area rose to 14.The advisory from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns pregnant women and women planning to have a child to stay away from a 1-square-mile area in Miami’s Wynwood section — and urges anyone who has visited there since June 15 to wait at least two months to conceive.“We are reviewing historical records, but this may be, in fact, the first time we’ve ever told people not to travel to a particular area in the continental US due to an outbreak of an infectious disease,”  CDC  senior press officer Tom Skinner told The Post.The New York City Health Department updated its own travel warnings to include Wynwood.“The fact that Zika is spreading locally in this Miami neighborhood means that pregnant women, women trying to conceive, and their sexual partners put themselves and their unborn child at risk of potential Zika infection when visiting this area,” New York officials said in a statement.The advisory came after Florida health officials identified 10  new Zika cases transmitted through local mosquitoes,  said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC.The new infections bring the total number of locally transmitted Zika cases in Florida to 14.Frieden said it has been difficult to control the mosquito population in Wynwood, a rapidly gentrifying district with a cutting-edge arts scene and bustling nightlife.“It’s an unusual area,” he said, noting buildings range from “industrial to residential and high-end.”“What we have learned over the past 48 hours is that mosquito control efforts don’t appear to have been as effective as we have hoped,” he said.Frieden said most of the Zika cases were within a 500-foot area.“We don’t have evidence that it has spread more broadly,” he said.Florida Gov. Rick Scott called for a federal emergency response team to combat the problem, and the CDC said it was dispatching several experts at his request.Frieden warned that there will likely be more cases in Florida and urged women to take the warning seriously. Infection has been tied to severe birth defects, including microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads.“The tragedy of a preventable case of a severe birth defect is something that we have to make very clear to people,” he said.“It is truly a scary situation, but it’s not immediately apparent to people that it is this kind of a significant risk.”Marisol Ramos, 21, who was boarding a flight from JFK Airport to her new home in Jacksonville, Fla., with her toddler, said she was concerned.“Once I touch down there, I will schedule an appointment with my doctor and make sure I take every step to stay safe and healthy,” she said. “If I was pregnant, I would cancel my trip just because it’s better to be safe than sorry.

Iranians are hot and bothered over a busty porn star who dared to visit the country for a cut-rate nose job — and then brag about how great it went.Candy Charms, best known for her 32LL boobs, boasted on Instagram over the weekend about her new symmetrical schnoz under a pouty photo of herself wearing a hijab, according to the  UK Express .“My nose was not straight and they are the best in the world in nose surgery. I had my nose done,” she wrote about her Iranian jaunt.“Loved Tehran. The people are so kind and generous. Really overwhelmed by the whole trip. The people are amazing,” wrote the blond bombshell, who has appeared in porn such as “Hot and Mean” and “Red Light Central TV.”More than 40,000 people commented on the post, many of them calling a porn star s very presence in the country offensive.Some users claimed an adult entertainment actress shouldn’t have been allowed into the strictly Islamic republic, the  UK Mirror reported .“What was a slut like you doing in my country?” wrote one user, Nasser, according to the Iranian news outlet.“If you sat in front of the cab there would have been no need for airbags,” another user, Ali, teased.But others were charmed by her presence. Welcome to Iran also I am so disappointed I couldn t meet you,  one fan, Arash, cheered on Instagram.Iran has become a tourist destination for high-quality plastic surgery at bargain-basement rates in recent years. The cost of surgery ranges from roughly $1,800 to $4,600 — just a fraction of the prices in the US and Britain, according to the paper.Nose jobs are the most popular form of surgery in Iran because many women wear headwear and cover their bodies.The country has the fourth most booming nose job industry in the world, after Brazil, Mexico and the United States, the paper reported.The Essex, England-based porn star s original post has since been deleted.&mdash; Candy Charms (@CandyCharms69)  July 11, 2016

Hillary Clinton will get a helping hand at a fundraiser in Omaha, Nebraska, Monday from deep-pocketed investor Warren Buffett — the third billionaire in less than a week to jump to the Democratic presidential nominee s aid.The two will hold a public rally together at Omaha North High Magnet School, where Clinton “will discuss her commitment to building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top,”  according to the Clinton campaign. Nebraska, a deeply Republican state, splits its electoral votes proportionally — and the Clinton campaign said it believes it can pick up the congressional district in which Buffett lives.Mark Cuban, the reality TV show host and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, appeared with Clinton over the weekend in his hometown of Pittsburgh — and  bashed the only billionaire in the presidential race,  Donald Trump.“Trump scares me,” Cuban told CNN. “Donald, initially, I really hoped he would be something different, that as a businessperson, I thought there was an opportunity there. But then he went off the reservation and went bats— crazy.”And former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg  came to Clinton’s defense at the Democratic National Convention  last week in Philadelphia.“I m a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one,” Bloomberg said of Trump.

A $1 pocket-sized version of the US Constitution displayed at the Democratic convention by a Muslim-American lawyer whose Army captain son was killed in Iraq is now the number two  bestselling book on Amazon.  Only  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child   was selling more copies as of Monday morning, according to the online retailer’s website.The sudden interest in the 52-page volume came after  Khizr Khan held up his own pocket copy  and wondered aloud if Donald Trump — who wants to ban Muslims from entering the US — had even read it. Trump responded to Khan’s remarks  by slamming him and even bizarrely questioning why his wife — Gold Star Mother Ghazala Khan — didn’t speak herself at the convention. She responded that she remained too upset about his death.The Amazon version is not the exact same copy held up by Khan.

**************-----Armed trio stopped by cops trying to stock up at Walmart for 'Doomsday'  -----  August 1   2:04pm
-----
Three kooks – including one wearing protective gear and armed with an AK-47   were taken into custody after they tried to stock up on supplies at a Kentucky Walmart in preparation for what they believed was an impending Doomsday, police said Monday.Two men and a woman drove with the assault rifle and a .357 Magnum revolver to the Walmart on Richmond Road in Lexington, Kentucky at about 11:15 p.m. Sunday, cops said. A six-month old baby and a stash of marijuana were also in the car.An eagle-eyed observer quickly called police after noticing one of the men was sporting camouflage gear and a bulletproof vest while brandishing the loaded weapons, cops said.Responding officers coaxed the trio out of their car and brought them to police headquarters for questioning, cops said.The three allegedly told investigators that they went to Walmart to pick up supplies because they were preparing for the end of the world.They were released without being charged because Kentucky is an open carry state and, therefore, it’s legal for them to possess the guns without a permit.“They are all friends and they said they were preparing for a doomsday or Armageddon-type situation,” Lexington police spokeswoman Brenna Angel told The Post.Angel said the gunman had recently been in a car accident and received a large settlement, which he was using to put their plan in place.“They wanted to use the settlement money to purchase equipment in the event that Armageddon comes,” Angel said.She added, “Because of their cooperation, the officers used their discretion regarding the small amount of marijuana and decided not to issue them a citation [for it].”Police took photos of the guns and the car to prepare a report for the Cabinet of Health and Family Services, which could launch an investigation into the care of the infant, who remains in the trio’s custody.

This Virginia woman thought she was about to get a speeding ticket, but got something much sweeter from these two cops.A one-minute video posted by Halifax police officer Kevin Lands to Facebook last Wednesday shows fellow officer Brian Warner approaching a Toyota sedan.“Were you familiar with why I pulled you over today?” Warner asks the female driver.She mumbles back, “No. I mean, no sir.”Warner continues, asking her, “Are you familiar with vehicle code 1.7.3.9?”When the woman shakes her head, the officer reveals that it’s not a real violation.“It’s actually against the law to drive on a hot day without an ice cream cone,” he said, handing her a frozen treat.The serious look on her face instantly melts away as she breaks into a fit of laughter.“Oh my God!” she shrieks.“We’re just making sure everyone is following all the laws today,” Warner said.The woman was among the dozen or so drivers pranked by the cops last week.Nearly 26,000 people have shared the post, which has over 4.2 million views, thanking the Virginia police officers for their dedication to the job.“That s so damn COOL! Lol!! Much respect for that!! #salute,” Aleko Mangum commented.“What a wonderful way to show some love!! Way to go to Halifax, VA!!! Very proud!!” another commented.

**************-----FBI electronics technician charged with spying for China  -----  August 1   1:30pm
-----
A nearly 20-year FBI veteran from Brooklyn pleaded guilty Monday to passing on confidential information — including the identity and travel patterns of a special agent — to a Chinese government official in exchange for money.Kun Shan “Joey” Chun, 47, admitted to violating his security clearance multiple times between 2011 and 2016 in order to pass on secret government information to China.He faces roughly two years in prison under a plea deal he hatched with Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office in exchange for his guilty plea.Bharara called Chun’s betrayal “all the more duplicitous” due to his FBI ties.Chun, who worked as an FBI electronics technician since 1997, met a man who identified himself as a Chinese government official in 2011 while traveling in Europe, Assistant U.S. Attorney Emil Bove said on Monday.At the time, Chun had already had long-standing and illegal ties to a Chinese tech company, Zhuhai Kolion Technology, which paid for prostitutes for him, and which gave his parents money, officials said.Kolion, which makes parts for printers, didn’t return a request for comment.A few years later, in 2013, he also passed on the organizational chart of the FBI’s New York bureau after being asked by the unnamed official about the enforcement agency’s “internal structure.”In 2015, he also passed on photographs of documents detailing the FBI’s surveillance technologies, which he took using his cell phone in an FBI restricted area.“I knew it was wrong and I am sorry for my actions,” Chun told Manhattan federal magistrate judge James Francis.Chun was caught by a fellow FBI agent, who posed as a contractor for the Department of Defense in a 2015 sting operation.Chun fell for the trap and recruited the undercover agent to hand over “sensitive information to his Chinese associates,” in exchange for a cut of any profits.Chun told the uncover agent that that he knew what he was doing was wrong. “I’m already in deep s​ t you know cause   people that I met you know over there in China, I never disclose that, never. That’s a f​ ing violation.”

**************-----America launches airstrikes against ISIS in Libya  -----  August 1   12:05pm
-----
WASHINGTON — The United States launched multiple airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Libya on Monday, opening a new, more persistent front against the group at the request of the United Nations-backed government, Libyan and US officials said.Fayez Serraj, the head of the UN-brokered presidency council, said in a televised statement that American warplanes attacked the IS bastion of Sirte on the Mediterranean in northern Libya. No US ground forces will be deployed, he said.The precision strikes, which targeted an  Islamic State  tank and vehicles, come amid growing concerns about the group s increased threat to Europe and its ability to inspire attacks across the region. The presidency council, as the general army commander, has made a request for direct US support to carry out specific airstrikes,  Serraj said.  The first strikes started today in positions in Sirte, causing major casualties. The strikes mark the start of a more intense American role in the fight against IS in Libya, as the US steps in to assist the fragile, UN-backed government there. They were the first strikes by the US on the group in Libya since February.In a statement, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said President Barack Obama authorized the strikes following a recommendation from Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They are consistent with our approach to combating ISIL by working with capable and motivated local forces,  said Cook, using another name for the Islamic State group, adding that  additional US strikes will continue to target ISIL in Sirte. US officials earlier this year estimated there were as many as 6,000 Islamic State insurgents in Libya, including some who have abandoned Syria. But in recent months, officials say, their numbers in Libya have declined and the group is weakening there under pressure from local militias and the UN-brokered government.Just last week, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that Islamic State fighters in Libya are facing the  distinct possibility  of defeat in their last stronghold.And Dunford estimated in mid-July that there were only a few hundred militants still inside Sirte, which the group has used as a headquarters. I don t think there is any doubt that the Islamic State in Libya is weaker than it was some months ago,  said Dunford, adding,  They ve suffered significant casualties in and around the Benghazi area. Without mentioning any future US military plans in Libya, Dunford said that  whatever actions we conduct,  aside from those meant to eliminate an IS threat to the US homeland,  are going to be in conjunction with  the UN-backed government of national accord.In February, American F-15E fighter-bombers struck an Islamic State training camp in rural Libya near the Tunisian border, killing more than 40.Libya slid into chaos after the ouster and killing of dictator Col. Moammar Khadafy in 2011. The power and security vacuum left the country a breeding ground for militias, and militants including the Islamic State group and al Qaeda affiliates.Since 2014, Libya has been split between rival governments and parliaments based in the western and eastern regions, each backed by different militias and tribes. The UN brokered a deal in December that tried to mend the rift by creating a presidency council and a unity government. The deal envisions an up to two-year transitional period, followed by a vote on a draft constitution and then presidential or parliamentary elections.Libya s pro-government militias — mainly from the western city of Misrata — have been waging an offensive against the Islamic State group in Sirte since May.

**************-----Florida seeks federal emergency response to Zika outbreak  -----  August 1   11:48am

MIAMI — Gov. Rick Scott asked Monday for a federal emergency response team to help the state combat the spread of the Zika virus in the US, saying the number of cases in Florida had increased to 14.The new cases are clustered in the same square-mile neighborhood in Miami-Dade County identified last week. Florida health officials said in a news release Monday they believe active transmissions of Zika are occurring only in that area.Officials announced four cases on Friday, believed to be the first people to contract the virus from mosquitoes within the 50 states.US health officials do not expect widespread outbreaks of the sort seen in Brazil and Latin America. Although most people who get Zika don t know they re sick, infection during pregnancy can cause babies to be born with small heads and other defects.More than 1,650 people in the mainland US have been infected with Zika in recent months, nearly all while traveling abroad.On Friday, Florida agricultural officials immediately announced more aggressive mosquito-control efforts, and Florida politicians rushed to assure tourists it s still safe to visit the state.The four Florida infections are thought to have occurred in a small area just north of downtown Miami, in the Wynwood arts district.The area, known for bold murals spray-painted across warehouses, art galleries, restaurants and boutiques, is rapidly gentrifying and has a number of construction sites where standing water can collect and serve as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

**************-----Texas college students can now go to class armed  -----  August 1   10:36am
-----
A new law went into effect in Texas on Monday that allows certain students to bring guns into classrooms, with supporters saying it could prevent mass shootings and critics saying the measure will endanger safety on campuses.The so-called state  campus carry  law allows people 21 and older with a concealed handgun license to carry pistols in classrooms and buildings throughout public colleges, including the University of Texas system, one of the nation s largest with an enrollment of more than 214,000 students.The law took effect on the 50th anniversary of one of the deadliest US gun incidents on a college campus, when a student named Charles Whitman killed 16 people by firing from a perch atop the clock tower at the University of Texas at Austin, the state s flagship public university.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who supports campus carry, said a gunman could already bring a firearm onto campus, and the law could prevent mass shootings because someone with a licensed concealed weapon could be ready to confront a gunman. What campus carry does is that it only authorizes those who go through the special training and background  to carry firearms, he was quoted as saying by his office.University of Texas professors lobbied unsuccessfully to prevent the law, arguing that the combination of youth, firearms and college life could make for a deadly situation. University President Gregory Fenves reluctantly allowed campus carry, saying he was compelled to do so under state law.Last month, three professors sued to block the law, saying it could have a chilling effect on academic freedom. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said the law was constitutionally sound and he would defend it.The law allows private colleges to opt out, and most of the state s best-known private universities have done so, saying the measure runs counter to protecting student safety.Eight states allow people to carry concealed weapons on public post-secondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.At the University of Texas Austin campus, third-year student Courtney Dang said the idea of campus carry was scary. There are so many students battling the stress of campus. Some are unstable and we don t know who has a gun,  said Dang.

Former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn and Donald Trump’s one-time campaign manager Corey Lewandowski got into a heated exchange on live TV Monday that led Lewandowski to warn,  Don t touch me. Four months earlier, a reporter charged it was Lewandowski doing the touching when he grabbed her arm at a Trump rally in Florida.The surrogates for Hillary Clinton and the GOP nominee were going toe to toe over  Trump’s battle with the family of a slain Muslim-American soldier  when Lewandowski told Quinn to lower her volume.“You got to relax a little bit,” Lewandowski said as they sat next to each other on the set of CNN’s “New Day.” “You gotta relax. “I do not have to relax,” Quinn shot back.That’s when Quinn’s left hand appeared to brush Lewandowski and he called foul.“Excuse me, don t touch me,” Lewandowski said. “Don’t touch me.”“Oh, calm down with your…,” Quinn retorted. “This isn t about politics. This isn t about presidential campaigns. This is not even about me nicely touching your arm. It is about decency and Gold Star parents.”Virginia lawyer Khizr Khan became the surprise star of last week’s Democratic National Convention when he took the stage and told the story of his slain US Army son, who died in Iraq in 2004. Khan blasted Trump for his call to ban Muslims  from immigrating to the United States.Lewandowski said Monday that Trump has every right to fight back against Khan.He even went as far as saying the Khans’ story is no greater than those of the other 7,000 American families who have lost loved ones to the ongoing wars on terror.“The parents chose to go and tell their story. That s OK. Look, I have a brother who s an active-duty Marine. My father fought in Vietnam. My grandfather fought in World War II. OK, don t tell me about patriotism,” Lewandowski said.“But if I choose to tell my story in front of the American people, I ve now engaged and have opened myself up so that people will respond to my story, whether it s right or wrong. They (the Khan family) chose publicly to tell their story. It s a very sad story, but they re one of 7,000 families.” Lewandowski got into a jam in March when Michelle Fields , a reporter for Breitbart News, claimed her arm was bruised when he grabbed it forcefully to block her from approaching Trump at a Florida rally.

Hillary Clinton has opened up a seven-point lead on Donald Trump, according to a new national poll out Monday. The CBS survey  — taken in the days following last week’s Democratic National Convention — shows Clinton leading Trump 46 percent to 39 percent, a significant bounce from a July 25 poll  taken immediately after the Republican convention , when the two were tied at 42 percent apiece.Even better news for the Democratic presidential candidate is that adults have a slightly  more favorable view of her following both conventions. Clinton is now looked on favorably by 36 percent of adults — but has a 50 percent unfavorable rating. Previously, Clinton had a favorable rating of 31 percent, compared with 56 percent who viewed her unfavorably.Trump’s favorable rating, meanwhile, has dropped to 31 percent (it was previously at 34 percent), though his unfavorable rating is down a tick, moving to 52 percent from 53 percent.Supporters of both candidates appear to be very committed to their man or woman. Ninety-two percent of Clinton voters have their minds made up, while only 7 percent might change their minds; 91 percent of Trump voters have their minds made up, with 8 percent saying they might change their choice.The CBS poll surveyed 1,393 adults across the country, via cellphones and landlines, and was conducted July 29-31.

**************-----Trump doubles down in fight with family of fallen Muslim soldier  -----  August 1   9:37am

The war of words between Donald Trump and the grieving parents of a slain Muslim-American soldier continued Monday, as a group of Gold Star families demanded an apology for “repugnant” comments made by the GOP presidential nominee. Trump responded in real time  as Khizr Khan, father of slain Army Capt. Humayun Khan, continued to blast the mogul on TV,  appearing on CNN s  New Day   and declaring that  We will continue to speak until this candidate speaks in a dignified manner. Trump swiftly took to Twitter: “Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same   Nice!” Trump tweeted Monday morning, echoing a tweet from the day before.“This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!”&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  July 31, 2016 The elder Khan electrified last week’s Democratic National Convention,  sharing his son’s heroic tale of service and blasting Trump , who has called for a ban on Muslim immigrants.Trump has refused to stand down against Khan’s tough assessment.  He accused the Khan family  of keeping the soldier’s mom, Ghazala Khan, quiet as part of an anti-woman dictate of Islam.The grieving mom, who stood silently next to her husband as he spoke to Democrats last week, has said she can barely discuss her son’s death in Iraq in 2004. In interviews since Thursday, Ghazala Khan said she tries to avoid rooms where her son’s picture hangs for fear of breaking down in tears.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined the fray Monday morning, issuing a strongly worded statement ripping his party’s nominee. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump s statements. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers or candidates,” according to McCain,  whose own imprisonment during the Vietnam War was once mocked by Trump , who said of it, “I like people who weren’t captured.”“While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us. Other GOP senators — Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rob Portman of Ohio, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Mark Kirk of Illinois and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — also distanced themselves from Trump.The Veterans of Foreign Wars also weighed in.“To Mr. Trump, I would simply say: Hands off Gold Star families,” said Kirk, who withdrew his endorsement of the GOP nominee in June.Gold Star families agreed.Also Monday, family members of 11 slain service members wrote to Trump insisting on an apology.“Your recent comments regarding the Khan family were repugnant, and personally offensive to us,”  according to an open letter  Monday from the left-leaning veterans advocacy group VoteVets.org.“When you question a mother s pain, by implying that her religion, not her grief, kept her from addressing an arena of people, you are attacking us. When you say your job building buildings is akin to our sacrifice, you are attacking our sacrifice.”Trump’s VP choice, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, tried to tamp down the issue Sunday night, paying respect to the Khan family. Donald Trump and I believe that Capt. Humayun Khan is an American hero and his family, like all Gold Star families, should be cherished by every American,” according to Pence.Trump was to appear at two rallies Monday in key swing states, in Columbus, Ohio, in the afternoon and then in Harrisburg, Pa., in the evening.

LOCKHART, Texas — The pilot of a hot air balloon that  crashed in Texas and killed all 16 people aboard  was arrested in Missouri in 2000 for driving while intoxicated, and the Better Business Bureau warned consumers about doing business with a balloon touring company he used to operate in that state.Authorities haven t publicly named anyone killed in the crash, saying it could take a while to identify the bodies. But Alfred  Skip  Nichols, 49, was identified as the pilot by his friend and roommate Alan Lirette, who said that Nichols was a good pilot. That s the only thing I want to talk about, is that he s a great pilot,  Lirette said, speaking to the Associated Press from a house he shared with Nichols in Kyle, Texas.  There s going to be all kinds of reports out in the press and I want a positive image there too. Authorities say the balloon, which was operated by Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides, hit high-tension power lines before crashing into a pasture Saturday morning near Lockhart, which is about 60 miles northeast of San Antonio. Margaret Wylie, who lives a quarter-mile from the site, said she heard popping sounds and saw what looked  like a fireball going up. National Transportation Safety Board investigators are trying to determine what caused the crash, said board member Robert Sumwalt. He said the pilot was licensed to fly the balloon, but that it was too soon to say whether he had a criminal history.A Missouri police officer, though, told the Associated Press that Nichols was arrested there in 2000 on a felony charge of driving while intoxicated. The case was resolved two years later when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor version of the charge.The officer said that based on photographs, he is confident the man arrested in Missouri is the same man who piloted the Texas balloon. Nichols had lived in Missouri before moving to Texas. He was known as  Skip  in both places and owned a hot air balloon touring company in St. Louis County at the time, said the officer, who spoke to the AP on condition that he not be identified because he was not authorized to comment publicly.The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 2008 that the Better Business Bureau had warned consumers about doing business with Nichols, the third time since 2000 that Nichols had gotten an unsatisfactory record for not responding to complaints. The paper quoted the BBB as saying Nichols was on probation in Missouri for the distribution, delivery or manufacturing of a controlled substance and that when asked to respond, Nichols said,  I prefer to make no comment on that. There were reports of foggy weather in the area of the crash around the time of the flight. At least two of the passengers, Matt Rowan and his wife, Sunday Rowan, posted photos on social media of the preparations, the sunrise and themselves in the basket of the balloon a short time before the crash.Ground crew members told investigators that they launched about 20 minutes after the expected 6:45 a.m. time. The balloon traveled about 8 miles from takeoff to crash, and the basket was found about three-quarters of a mile from the balloon itself.NTSB investigators recovered 14 personal electronic devices, including cellphones, an iPad and three cameras, from the crash site, which will be sent to a lab in Washington for analysis.Sumwalt, the NTSB member, said the immediate focus of the investigation would be gathering witness testimony, starting Monday with the ground crew. They ve been busy trying to collect the maintenance records for us,  Sumwalt said of the crew.

**************-----Trump vows to crack down on internet porn  -----  August 1   9:20am
-----
Donald Trump will crack down on internet pornography if elected president, vowing to appoint a commission to examine its  harmful public health impact. News of the promise —  which comes as racy photos of his wife, Melania,  were obtained by The Post — is part of “The Children’s Internet Safety Presidential Pledge” from the group Enough Is Enough, which  Trump signed on July 16. The anti-porn commitment means he promises to “uphold the rule of law by aggressively enforc[ing] existing federal laws to prevent the sexual exploitation of children online, including the federal obscenity laws, child pornography laws, sexual predation laws and the sex trafficking laws.”He also pledges to:“Aggressively enforce the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) requiring schools and public libraries using government eRate monies to filter child pornography and pornography by requiring effective oversight by the Federal Communications Commission;“Protect and defend the innocence of America’s children by advancing public policies that prevent the sexual exploitation of children in a manner that is consistent with the government’s compelling interest in protecting its most vulnerable citizens, within the limits set forth by the First Amendment.”Hillary Clinton has not signed the anti-porn pledge, citing a policy of not signing pledges,  according to the Washington Examiner.  The racy snaps capture 25-year-old Melania Trump  — then Melania Knauss — in various stages of mostly undress, and in at least one, in a nude embrace with another woman. The photos were published in a now-defunct French magazine in the 1990s. Trump spokesman Jason Miller told CNN  that the mogul is “a little more focused on the direction of the country and what we need to do to get it turned around.  “They’re a celebration of the human body as art , and [there’s] nothing to be embarrassed about with the photos. She’s a beautiful woman,” Miller added.  Here s what New Yorkers think about Melania Trump s nude photos:  

**************-----Syrian child actor killed in Aleppo  -----  August 1   8:08am
-----
The sit-com is a little like  I Love Lucy,  starring a comic housewife who gets into shenanigans and bickers with her husband. Except children play all the roles. And it all takes place in one of the historic stone houses in the old city of Aleppo, besieged by government forces in one of the worst battlegrounds of Syria s civil war. Um Abdou the Aleppan  is a small curiosity of the 5-year-old war, the first sit-com produced out of rebel-held  parts of Syria. Aired in 2014 on a local Aleppo station, it was a light-hearted look at life in the war-ravaged city, finding comedy as it showed residents dealing with everything from cut-offs in electricity and water, to factionalism among rebels, to bombardments and violence. The child actors, even as they spot-on mimic characters of a traditional Aleppo neighborhood, provide a tone of innocence.The tragic reality intruded on that innocence this month.Qusai Abtini, the 14-year-old boy who played the husband, was killed when a missile struck the car he was in as he tried to escape Aleppo. Fresh-faced with a toothy grin and thick black hair, Qusai had become a local celebrity.His life and death underscored the suffering of Aleppans, whose city was once the commercial center of Syria with a thriving, unique culture but has now been torn to pieces by fighting, with whole neighborhoods left in ruin. Tens of thousands in the city have been killed since the summer of 2012, when Aleppo split into rebel- and government-held districts and the two sides turned on each other.In recent weeks, government forces have tightened their siege of rebel-held sections, trying to cut off the last escape routes. Days after Qusai s death, several dozen men marched through his home district in a symbolic funeral, waving opposition flags and chanting,  Qusai has gone to heaven. Bashar is the killer of my people,  referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad. Umm Abdou the Aleppan  aired in nearly 30 episodes, each about 10 minutes long, on the opposition station Halab Today TV. It was filmed in Aleppo, even as the city was subjected almost daily to bombardment. In one outtake, three girls performing a scene jump at the sound of an explosion, then go on with their lines.Bashar Sakka, the director, said he cast kids because children are the witnesses to  the massacres committed by Assad against childhood. The show is steeped in the atmosphere of Aleppo, Syria s largest city, taking place in the stone alleyways of one of its old neighborhoods, with the dialogue in the city s distinct accent of Arabic. The title character, Um Abdou, was played by a young girl named Rasha, while Qusai played her husband, Abu Abdou.Both show a talent for comic timing, playing a stereotypical traditional husband and wife. He s domineering and patriarchal. She s clever, ambitious and a bit ditzy, dealing with neighboring families living on top of each other in close quarters.In one episode, the mother of a rebel fighter visits, looking to marry her son to Um Abdou s daughter. Over tea, Um Abdou tells her all her daughters are married to members of the Free Syrian Army, the comparatively secular rebel umbrella group. When she learns that the prospective groom is a  mujahid  — an Islamic militant fighter — she slyly demands a high dowry to intentionally foil the negotiations.In another episode, Um Abdou decides with her girlfriends to form an all-female rebel faction. Abu Abdou teases her, saying,  You want to go to the front lines when you re afraid of cockroaches.  Then he tells her there s a mouse under the couch and laughs as she jumps up and screams.Another scene has Abu Abdou going with rebels on a raid, but Um Abdou gossips about it to all her neighbors — and her husband comes back wounded from an ambush by government forces who learned of the planned attack.  I wonder how everyone found out!  Um Abdou muses. Qusai was a very talented boy,  Sakka told the Associated Press.  We were looking for an intelligent boy,  he said from southern Turkey via Skype.  We wanted him to be free with ideas, and without fear of Bashar Assad s regime and its ruthlessness. Qusai was 10 years old when mass protests first erupted against Assad s rule erupted in March 2011. He became quickly entangled in the uprising, taking part in anti-Assad demonstrations, often sitting on his older brother s shoulders. He spoke in opposition videos, criticizing Assad s government and describing Aleppo s destruction.At the same time, he acted in school plays. Afraa Hashem, his school s director, saw his talent and introduced him to Sakka. He was very ambitious. Once he moved from acting in plays to TV, his dreams broadened and worked on transforming what he was living through  into his performances, she said, speaking from Aleppo via Skype.After the TV series, Qusai had roles in local theater. Last summer, he played a rebel killed in fighting. As his mother weeps over his body, a man tells her:  Be happy for him. He wanted martyrdom and got it. During recent shelling, Qisai s home was hit and his father was wounded and left bound to a wheelchair. On July 8, the father decided to send his children out of Aleppo.But as the car Qusai was in made a run down the one road out of rebel-held parts of Aleppo, a missile struck it.In a video of the symbolic funeral a few days later, his father in his wheelchair watches the marchers go by, holding a placard reading,  Qusai, Abu Abdu the Aleppan. You are a little hero. You scared the regime with your giant acts so they killed you.

The mother-in-law of Formula 1 chief Bernie Ecclestone was rescued by Brazilian cops Sunday after being kidnapped more than a week ago.Members of the elite Sao Paulo anti-kidnapping division saved Aparecida ­Schunk — the 67-year-old mother of Ecclestone’s third wife, Fabiana Flosi — following a daring raid, according to the Daily Mirror.She was found unharmed in a building as officers arrested two suspects.Schunk’s captors had demanded that a ransom of about $36 million be paid in exchange for her freedom, but Brazilian news outlets reported that not a dime was paid.It was the largest ransom demand in the country’s history.The kidnappers, several of whom are still believed to be on the loose, had posed as delivery drivers, even carrying a bogus package, when they snatched ­Schunk from her home in Sao Paolo on July 22.Ecclestone, who runs the Formula 1 group of companies that oversee the prominent European racing series, is believed to be worth more than $3 billion.

**************-----Dems slam Cuomo for snubbing de Blasio repeatedly at DNC  -----  August 1   5:27am
-----
Prominent state Democrats are accusing Gov. Andrew Cuomo of directly contradicting Hillary Clinton’s message of party unity by bringing his escalating war with Mayor Bill de Blasio to the  Democratic convention  in Philadelphia.One senior Democrat told The Post that Cuomo’s repeated snubbing of de Blasio at the convention had also “backfired on the governor’’ and left many New York delegates convinced the governor “was petty and divisive at a time when we were all preaching party unity.’’Another party leader, well known to Cuomo and other top elected officials for many years, said convention events showed that things were so bad between the governor and the mayor that “an intervention’’ by New York’s senior senator, Chuck Schumer, or by a group of senior Democrats, may be the only thing that could end their ongoing war.Both prominent Democrats were delegates to the convention and insisted that their names be kept confidential for fear of retaliation by Cuomo.Cuomo, who controlled the New York delegation breakfasts, repeatedly raised eyebrows as he conspicuously  failed to acknowledge de Blasio’s presence  and then  failed to give the mayor time  to deliver a planned breakfast address Thursday, speaking himself during a time slot that de Blasio had hoped to fill.That widely reported snub took on an even darker tone as several Democrats saw Cuomo’s operatives accommodate Schumer, who, like de Blasio, had a later speaking engagement that required an early appearance before the New Yorkers.“Schumer arrived and said, ‘I have to go someplace to speak after this,’ and they just let him speak at our breakfast, even when de Blasio couldn’t,’’ said a source with firsthand knowledge.The senior Democrat said Cuomo’s behavior “backfired’’ and said that after de Blasio was shunned, “the delegates from all across the state were talking about how petty the governor was being.”“Many people who left the convention felt for de Blasio, in terms of the way he was being treated, and because many of them have also been treated by Cuomo the same way in the past,’’ he continued.The prominent leader said the entire Democratic Party was suffering because of the Cuomo/de Blasio feud and noted, “It’s hurting both of the antagonists as well. Neither looks good.”He added, “We need to be unified to win elections. If we’re fighting each other, how are we going to be able to focus on winning the state Senate?”A request for comment from Cuomo was answered by state Democratic Committee Executive Director Basil Smikle, who insisted — despite claims from de Blasio’s allies to the contrary — that the governor was “unaware that the mayor had another engagement.’’

Pope Francis has a perfectly good reason for why he  took a tumble at a Mass in Poland  last week: He was watching Madonna.Sort of.“I was looking at [an image of] the Madonna, and I forgot the step,” he said Sunday aboard a plane back to Rome after celebrating World Youth Day.Francis had been sprinkling incense around an outdoor altar at the Jasna Gora Monastery, in Czestochowa, when he took his dramatic, mid-Mass tumble on July 28.“I let myself fall, and this saved me, Because if I tried to resist it, I would have gotten hurt,” Francis explained.    

**************-----Human chain saves woman from severe flash flood  -----  August 1   4:19am
-----
    Dramatic video footage from deadly flooding in Maryland over the weekend shows several brave bystanders grasping hands to make a human chain to save a woman trapped in her car.Raging water had blasted the woman s vehicle down the street in low-lying historic Ellicot around 8:30 p.m. Two were killed in the flooding.One of the rescuers, identified as Jason Barnes by the person who posted the video, was nearly washed away as he attempted to make his way to the car but then righted himself against the current as three others braced themselves on an unseen object, linked hands and waded into the surging water.Unable to get the door open because of the high-pressure torrent, the woman climbed out the window and into Barnes  arms before being pulled into the safety of a nearby shop.Though the flash flood ravaged the city s Main Street for 30 minutes tops, many local businesses and homes sustained serious damage from the storm, officials said.The drag was one of the areas hardest hit after the river rose during a torrential downpour of 6.5 inches in just two hours according to the National Weather Service, eventually overflowing into the town of about 66,000.The bodies of a man and woman have been recovered, authorities said. Both were discovered in the Patapsco River.One of the victims was a pedestrian who was swept away by the raging torrent, police chief Gary Gardner told reporters.The other was carried downstream after abandoning a stranded vehicle, Gardner said.Ellicot City, which lies 14 miles west of Baltimore, was established in 1772 as a mill town alongside the Patapsco River.A majority of the town s 18th and 19th century buildings were still intact before Saturday s deluge, according to officials.Howard County Executive Allan Kittleman said the damage was the worst he d seen in 50 years. It looks like the set of a disaster movie,  Kittleman  told The Associated Press . Cars everywhere, cars on top of cars, parts of the road are gone, many parts of the sidewalk are gone, storefronts are completely gone.

Donald Trump’s campaign on Sunday defended his  wife’s old nude photos  as an artful “celebration of the human body” and added that the Republican presidential nominee isn’t upset by their publication in The Post.Trump spokesman Jason Miller noted that the  shots of Melania Trump  were taken before the couple knew each other.“They’re a celebration of the human body as art, and [there’s] nothing to be embarrassed about with the photos. She’s a beautiful woman,” Miller  told CNN’s “Reliable Sources.” In March, Trump retweeted an unflattering photo of rival Sen. Ted Cruz’s wife, Heidi, in response to a pro-Cruz group circulating a shot of Melania posing in the buff as a model.Asked whether Trump was upset over the release of the latest images, Miller said the billionaire was “a little more focused on the direction of the country and what we need to do to get it turned around.”GOP consultant Ed Rollins, who managed President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 re-election campaign, predicted the nudes would have virtually no impact on Trump’s chances.He noted that “the Christian right has made adjustments” and supports Trump even though he fathered a child out of wedlock and got married three times.Miller also denied any potential fallout.“We’re in an era where the Kardashians have thrown everything in our face. No one will be talking about this in a week,” he said.Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf, who worked for President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, likewise said voters “will be more focused on what Donald Trump says than what his wife looks like.”“Her beauty can’t save Donald Trump from his own mouth,” Sheinkopf quipped.  Melania Trump s nude photos are blowing New Yorkers  minds:   

**************-----Trump complains presidential debates conflict with NFL games  -----  August 1   2:38am
-----
WASHINGTON   The independent body that sets presidential debates Sunday defended its fall schedule in the face of criticism from Donald Trump that the system is rigged for low viewership.Trump is upset that two of the three face-offs will compete with televised NFL games. “As usual, Hillary &amp; the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!” Trump tweeted Friday, referring to DNC primary debates held on weekends.The Commission on Presidential Debates said it started “more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debates.”“It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles,” the non-partisan commission added. “A debate has never been rescheduled as a result.”The non-partisan, non-profit commission announced the debates in September 2015. The NFL released its 2016 schedule seven months later in April.Trump said he’d received a letter from the NFL complaining about the conflict.“I tell you what I don t like, it s against two NFL games,” Trump grumbled on ABC’s  This Week.  “I got a letter from the NFL saying ‘this is ridiculous, why are the debates against us?’ Because the NFL doesn t want to go against the debates.”The NFL swiftly rejected Trump’s claim:  While we d obviously wish the Debate Commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Mr. Trump,  spokesman Brian McCarthy told The Post.The debates are Monday, Sept. 26 at Hofstra University; Sunday, Oct. 9 at Washington University in St. Louis and Wednesday, Oct. 19 at the University of Nevada. A fourth vice presidential debate is Tuesday, Oct. 4.

**************-----Meet the psychic who uses gift to solve FBI cold cases  -----  August 1   2:27am
-----
Troy Griffin saw a dear friend get into a car accident six years ago.Trouble is, it hadn’t happened — yet.“I told my friend Diana, ‘I’m concerned about you driving home,’ ” Griffin, 51, tells me. The crash occurred as Griffin foresaw it. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured.But from that moment forward, Griffin could no longer deny something he’d known from the age of 12. He says he’s “psychic,” “clairvoyant” or a “medium” — horror-meister Stephen King would say he’s saddled with “The Shining” — although Griffin prefers the term “intuitive.”He says he can predict things people will say before they say them and events that will happen before they happen.He also sees dead people. Or so he claims.Here are two recent cases in which he’s used his sixth sense:Lora Hale Costner, a 42-year-old mother of two, went missing for three weeks in Tennessee earlier this year, and her sister-in-law was frantic. She asked Griffin to take the case after he contacted her through Facebook.Looking at the area in which Costner disappeared on Google Maps, “I see pictures, places and things. I saw the road [where she vanished]. I felt that there was drug use by the victim.”Griffin went back to Facebook, and zeroed in on three of Costner’s friends, two men and a woman he thought were involved. He sent his findings in a report to the sister-in-law, who forwarded it to police.“A few hours later, they found the body,” he said. Finally, 19-year-old McKinley Lane Cody was indicted for allegedly robbing Costner of prescription pain medication and murdering her by hitting her in the back of the head.Cody was Griffin’s main “person of interest.”The body of Ashley Jones, a 24-year-old mom of three, was found last year by a hiker after she went missing for seven weeks in rural Georgia, two months after telling family members “something is going to happen.” Police initially suspected a drug overdose, but her mom, who contacted Griffin, didn’t believe it. Neither did he.A man who Griffin suspected was involved in her death was arrested and charged in an unrelated kidnapping. The case of Ashley Jones remains open.Griffin, a devout Christian who once hosted an entertainment radio talk show in LA, says his extrasensory perception compelled him to sell his company, which converted real-estate and medical records into digital files. He’s now a freelance psychic detective who pays the bills by giving paranormal readings, at $90 a pop, to people who crave communing with the spirits of departed loved ones.You might call him a ghost whisperer. He rejects the titles “sorcerer” and “necromancer.”“Before I help anyone, I pray,” he says. “After, I also pray.”Griffin, who lives in Greenfield, Colo., and has a wife and son, uses his paranormal insights to provide clues that help solve “cold cases” that have confounded authorities. But he gets little official credit. Is he qualified to mess with the dead and the gone?Some victims’ family members, friends and lovers think so. Law enforcement officials, in this country and abroad, have quietly turned to psychics when all else fails.He finds the majority of his cases on the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System database — NamUs — whose pictures he scours until he gets a “feeling” about one. “They come to me in my dreams,” he says. “I see people’s faces and I look into their eyes.“The eyes tell me so much.”Griffin’s testimony is not admissible in court, but he says he’s worked on about 100 cases in the United States, Germany, Canada and Australia — 99 percent of them unpaid.“We all need to use our God-given gifts,” he says. “Your gift is journalism, that’s how you help people.”Flattery will get Griffin far — but I’m not sure it’s enough to erase mental images of storefront mediums and carnival fortune-tellers.Next, he might look for a way into a case that for nearly 20 years has flummoxed local cops and federal authorities — that of the  so-called Gilgo Beach Killer , an unknown serial slayer believed to have murdered between 10 and 17 people, some of them sex workers, and dumped their remains around Gilgo Beach on Long Island.“I want to see if I connect with the families, with the victims,” Griffin says.He may seem like an opportunist or attention whore, but I hope he gets involved.Police and FBI agents can use all the supernatural intuition they can get.Donald Trump  wins an upset victory  — in the TV ratings.Hillary Clinton’s “historic,” but clunky, speech at the Democratic National Convention Thursday night, after she became the first woman ever to accept a major party’s presidential nomination, drew 29.8 million TV viewers, according to Nielsen.But 32.2 million people tuned in to commercial networks to watch The Donald accept the Republican nomination at that party’s confab a week earlier, Nielson reported.I think the voters have spoken with their remote controls.I stood on a New York City street corner one recent lunchtime to  test a Post story declaring the necktie “dead.”  Surprise! The dodo bird may soon have company on the extinction list.Out of some 30 dudes, most wearing dress shirts and business suits, just four sported neckwear. (I think they came from out of town.)Helping inspire the bare-throated trend is a frequently casual Prince Harry of Britain, the sometimes tie-averse President Obama and hoodie-favoring tech startup company employees.Still, everyone I saw — male, female and everything else — wore tops, although that’s not required by law for people of any gender in New York state.Good thing for ordinary folks.Larry the lobster, a 15-pound behemoth bound for the dinner table in a Florida restaurant, was saved by crustacean-rescuers who packed him up in Styrofoam and shipped him to the Maine State Aquarium. But by the time the beastie arrived, he was dead. A crying shame.I’ll bet the big guy would have made a delicious meal.
